#TIC-TAC-TOE :
This Python script implements a Tic-Tac-Toe game where a human player can play against an AI opponent. The AI opponent uses the minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning to make its moves efficiently. The game interface prompts the player for moves, validates them, and displays the current state of the game board after each move. The AI evaluates possible future game states to make optimal moves, aiming to either win or force a draw. The game continues until one player wins, the board fills up resulting in a draw, or until the maximum number of moves (9) is reached. Overall, this script demonstrates the implementation of a playable Tic-Tac-Toe game with a challenging AI opponent.
